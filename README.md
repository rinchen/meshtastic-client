# Electastic

A cross-platform Meshtastic desktop client for **Mac**, **Linux**, and **Windows**.

Connect to your Meshtastic devices over Bluetooth, USB Serial, or WiFi — no python, no phone required.

> Originally ported from [Joey's (NV0N) Meshtastic Mac Client](https://github.com/rinchen/meshtastic_mac_client) and the Denver Mesh community. This is a full rewrite in Electron + React + TypeScript to support all platforms.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an early release. A lot of things might be buggy. This may or may not be updated over the coming days/weeks. So far it has only been tested on a **Mac** with a **T-Deck** in Bluetooth Pairing Mode.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (LTS recommended)
- **npm** 9+
- A Meshtastic device

### Mac

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denver-Mesh/meshtastic-client
cd meshtastic-client
npm install
npm start
```

You may need to allow Bluetooth access in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Bluetooth**.

### Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denver-Mesh/meshtastic-client
cd meshtastic-client
npm install
npm start
```

BLE requires BlueZ installed. If Bluetooth doesn't work, try launching with `--enable-features=WebBluetooth`.

### Windows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denver-Mesh/meshtastic-client
cd meshtastic-client
npm install
npm start
```

Should work out of the box. If serial isn't detected, make sure you have the correct USB drivers for your device.
