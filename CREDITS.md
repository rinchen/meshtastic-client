## Original Author

**Joey (NV0N)** created the original [Meshtastic Mac Client](https://github.com/rinchen/meshtastic_mac_client) — a Python/PyQt6 desktop application for macOS that connects to Meshtastic devices over Bluetooth Low Energy.

Joey built this out of frustration with the lack of native Bluetooth-capable Meshtastic clients for Mac, and shared it with the Denver Meshtastic community asking for help improving it.

## Electastic

**Electastic** is a cross-platform rewrite of Joey's original concept, built with Electron + React + TypeScript to run on Mac, Linux, and Windows. It uses the official Meshtastic JavaScript libraries and adds Serial and HTTP/WiFi connection support alongside the original BLE functionality.

This project exists because of Joey's initiative and the Denver Mesh community's collaborative spirit.
